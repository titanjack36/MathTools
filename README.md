# MathTools

MathTools is a simple maths API which provides computation for certain 
mathematical concepts.
The project is currently in early development stage and only features matrix
arithmetic operations. More elements from linear algebra and calculus will be
added as time progresses.
Disclaimer: There are already mathematical computation programs such as Wolfram
Alpha which are more efficient and powerful than this program. This project was
developed as a hobby and not meant to be used professionally.
