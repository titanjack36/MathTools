# MathTools

MathTools is a simple maths API coded in Java which provides computation for 
certain mathematical concepts.

The project is currently in early development stages and only features matrix
arithmetic operations. More elements from linear algebra and calculus will be
added as time progresses.

Disclaimer: There are already mathematical computation programs such as Wolfram
Alpha which are more efficient and powerful than this program. This project was
developed as a hobby and not meant to be used professionally.
